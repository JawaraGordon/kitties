1. Project Description

Thinking, thinking..... and ChatGPT comes to the rescue!!!
"Welcome to our fabulous feline haven, where we dish out cat facts like they're treats from the fancy feast. From the cute and cuddly to the curious and quirky, we've got all the purrfect details on our furry overlords. So sit back, relax, and let us whisker you away into the wonderful world of cats!"

This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It pulls from two APIs: 
* https://catfact.ninja
* https://unsplash.com/developers


2. Installation Instructions

If you would like to run this application, you must do the following:
* Fork the Respository
* Clone to your local environment
* Open the html file in your browser.
* You'll need an API key from the unplash API - first, create a .env file at the top level of your directory, and then set your key to a global variable aka `API_KEY = "thisismyapikey"`
